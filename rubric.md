# Assessment rubric

The following rubric will be used to grade the project work and report.

## Project work
Component  | Insufficient | Satisfactory | Excellent
--- | --- | --- | ---
**Design of research question** | Do not go further than the minimal working example in the assignments, poor or incorrect methodological choices |  Goes beyond the minimal working example in the assignment, well motivated and correct methodological choices | Novel research question
**Experiments** | Do not go much further than the minimal working example in the assignments, the experiments lack structure |  Goes beyond the minimal working example in the assignment, the experiments are somewhat structured and systematic | Carefully considered set of experiments that demonstrate a systematic approach to the problem
**Code** | Missing or incomplete code structure, runs with errors, lacks documentation | Self-contained, does not result in errors, contains some documentation, can be easily used to reproduce the reported results | User-friendly, well-structured (good separation of general functionality and experiments), detailed documentation, optimized for speed

## Report
Component  | Insufficient | Satisfactory | Excellent
--- | --- | --- | ---
**General** | Poor structure, unclear line of thought, inconsistent referencing, severe grammar mistakes | Legible structure, mostly clear line of thought, consistent referencing, spell-checkers do not detect errors | Excellent structure, easy to follow line of thought
**Introduction** | Does not describe the topic and goal of the project, contains irrelevant information | Clearly describes the topic and goal of the project | Describes a "broad picture" perspective of the project work (e.g. relation to other techniques and clinical applications)
**Methods** | Does not convey understanding of the material, descriptions of methods appear to be copied from another source | Conveys good understanding of the material, descriptions of the methods in own words | Conveys excellent level of understanding, makes connections between methods
**Results** | Poor choice of experiments and description, poor presentation of the results of the experiments | Good choice of experiments and description, clear and concise presentation of the results | Extensive set of experiments, excellent presentation of the results
**Discussion** | Repetitive, analysis is missing, missing discussion of strengths and weaknesses | Concise analysis of the results, discussion of strengths and weaknesses | In-depth analysis and discussion of the results, critical tone, summary of gained insights into the methodology, suggestions for further analysis
**Tables and figures** | Inconsistent formatting, not referenced in text, present irrelevant/incorrect information, poor captioning | Consistent formatting, correctly referenced in text, present relevant information, captions contain all necessary information | Excellent formatting, self-contained (can be easily understood on their own)

The assessment rubric was partially based on the UU Graduate School of Life Sciences writing assignment rubric available [here](http://rubric.gsls-uu.nl/rubrics/rubric-writing-assignment).
