    "Random variables map the outcomes of random phenomena to numbers. Remember the example with coin tossing in the lecture? There, we had a random variable $X$ (outcome of the coin toss), and another random variable $Y$ (the number of heads in a series of 3 tosses). To represent possible values and the respective probabilities of the magnitude of a random variable, we use probability distribution functions. In a similar way, we can define medical image intensities as random variables.\n",

    "### Probability mass function (a.k.a probability distribution table)\n",
    "Random phenomenon: Pick a random pixel location. In this case, the pixel intensity can be treated as a random variable. Each outcome from the random phenomenon we are studying can be associated with a probability. If a random variable $X$ can have a finite set of possible values, we can define a function that maps each possible value to a probability. This function is called **probability mass function** (PMF), and expresses a *discrete probability distribution*. \n",

    "What if we have two random variables? For example, the pixel intensity in two images. In such case, we can define a joint probability mass function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$p_{X,Y}(x,y) = P(X = x, Y = y)$\n",
    "\n",
    "PMF can be used to determine the probability of an observation being exactly equal to a discrete target value. But how can we define the probability mass function for the image intensities? We can use image histogram for this purpose by counting the number of occurrences of each intensity value in the image. In order to treat the counts of the histogram as probability values, we must normalize the histogram in such a way that all values sum to 1. This is the probability mass function for the pixel intensity as a random variable. \n",

    "\n",
    "### Probability density function\n",
    "Probability mass function is defined for discrete random variables. In case of continuous random variables, however, their probabilities are not directly measurable, and we therefore calculate the probability as the proportion of times. Imagine you had a random variable that measured the price of a diamond. Now, what is the probability that a single diamond's price is exactly equal to e.g. 150 USD? The probability of getting a diamond for that exact price would be very low, if any at all. Therefore, a given value of a variable on a continuous scale cannot be assigned a probability. We therefore need to think in terms of intervals instead of individual outcomes. For continuous random variables, which can take infinite number of possible values, we can define the **probability density function** (PDF), where the probability of $y \\in [a,b]$ is equivalent to the integral of the PDF between $a$ and $b$:\n",

    "###  Bayes’ rule \n",
    "Bayes’ rule is a very useful formula that we will use later in the computer-aided diagnosis notebooks of this course. \n",
    "The so-called Bayes' theorem gives the probability of an event based on new information that is, or may be related, to that event. Mathematically, the Bayes' theorem can be expressed as follow: \n",
    "\n",
    "$p_{X|Y} = \\frac{p_{Y|X}(x|y)p_{Y}(y)}{p_{X}(x)}$   ,\n",
    "\n",
    "where $X$ and $Y$ are events and $P(Y) \\neq 0$, and:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $p_{X|Y}$ is the probability of event $X$ occurring given event $Y$ is true; also known as the posterior probability of $X$ given $Y$\n",
    "- $p_{Y|X}(x|y)$ is the likelihood of $X$ given a fixed $Y$\n",
    "- $p_{X}(x)$ and $p_{Y}(y)$ are the probabilities of observing the two events without any given conditions; also known as marginal or prior probabilities\n",
    "- $X$ and $Y$ are events (must not be the same)\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayes' theorem is typically utilized in diagnostic decision-making, e.g. to find out if there is a certain clinical manifestation in a patient before images are acquired. Given the prevalence of a disease, a radiologist is able to first estimate the marginal probability of the disease and afterwards assess medical images based on this prior. The Bayes' rule enables to derive positive predictive and negative predictive values in radiologists' pre-assessment tasks. Furthermore, this probability theorem also has its utility in cases with similar imaging findings in different diagnoses to calculate the probability at which certain imaging characteristics pertain to rare or common diagnoses (regardless of complete clinical contexts). The Bayes' theorem is also used in algorithms for medical image artefact corrections, such as in MRI and perfusion-weighted images to reduce noise. Bayesian inference has a wide range of applications in AI-driven radiology software."

    "## 2. Image similarity metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the prevalence of 3D volumes in medical imaging, the term *voxel similarity measures* is typically used to jointly address these methods. In practice, algorithms perform registration between two images based on a voxel subset, which is either randomly chosen or defined by a grid. In other applications, segmentation algorithms aid registration by preselecting a subset of voxels comprising specific regions of interest. At last, similarity measures may be applied on e.g. image gradients instead of voxel values themselves. More details on image similarity metrics can be found in [Fitzpatrick, J.M., et al. Image registration, section 8.5.1](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.464.5408&rep=rep1&type=pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, you will implement two such image similarity metrics: correlation and mutual information. The computation of the mutual information between two images relies on their joint histogram, so one of the exercises deals with the implementation of this intermediate step. In the project work section you will use the similarity metrics to find the optimal rotation transformation that aligns two images.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you start, load your favorite test image in Python. You're going to use this image to test your implementation. Some of the examples below assume you work with images of type `uint8`, i.e. pixel intensities in the $[0, 255]$ range, but the provided functions are equipped to work with arbitrary image types."

    "\n",
    "Let $I$ and $J$ be two images and $i$ the pixel locations. A simple and intuitive intensity-based measure of the similarity of $I$ and $J$ is the sum of squared differences (SSD). The SSD will be equal to zero provided that both images are correctly aligned, and will grow with increasing registration error (misalignment). If $I$ is the fixed image in a registration problem, and $J$ is the moving image transformed with a transformation $T$, the similarity measure will be a function of the transformation. It can be shown that this measure is optimal when two images differ only by Gaussian noise. This is an implicit assumption of this measure, which does not hold for inter-modality registration, and is rarely true for intra-modality registration (e.g. MRI noise is non-Gaussian due to artifacts, which leads to changes between acquisitions, etc.). Nevertheless, SSD can still be successfully used in intra-modality registration. A possible drawback of this similarity measure is that it can be sensitive to “outlier” intensity differences. An SSD algorithm can be denoted as finding the transformation *T* to minimize for images $I$ and $J$: \n",

    "\n",
    "Another measure making slightly less assumptions is called (normalized) cross-correlation (CC). Normalized CC assumes there is a linear relationship between pixel intensities in two images, which frequently is the case for registration of images acquired with the same modality. The normalized cross-correlation between two images $I$ and $J$ with pixels $i$ and respective mean intensities $\\overline{I}$ and $\\overline{J}$ is:\n",

In its essence, MI is a measure of the “compactness” of the joint PMF of two images. When the two images are well registered, the joint PMF is compact. When the two images are not well aligned the joint PMF is “spread out”. \n",

Thus, in the previous equation, we can \"plug in\" the joint histogram for $p_{I, J}$, and analogously, the marginal histograms (the histograms of the individual images) for $p_{I}$ and $p_{J}$. The two sum operators go over all bins in the joint histogram."
