    "## Goal\n",
    "Develop Python code for point-based and intensity-based (medical) image registration. Propose and investigate a suitable research question of your choice. Use the developed code to perform image registration and evaluate and analyze the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset you will be using in the first project originates from the [MRBrainS medical image analysis challenge](http://mrbrains13.isi.uu.nl/). It consists of 18 traverse slices of MR brain scans with two different sequences: T1-weighted and T2-FLAIR (3 patients $\\times$ 3 slices per patient $\\times$ 2 modalities). Please see the [Getting started](#getting_started) assignment below for more details on the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The assignment consists of two parts, as a first step there is preliminary guided project work, and as a second step you must investigate a suitable research question based on the methods you have developed. A research question based on the preliminary guided project work below, completing the programming tasks and answering the theory questions, is the minimal solution to this project. If this is done well and accompanied by a suitable report, this will be graded with a ‘sufficient’ grade. To achieve higher grades, you need to go beyond the minimal solution. You should use what you have implemented and the available data to come up with and answer a suitable research question. Write about this in your report.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div id=\"deliverables\"></div>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deliverables\n",
    "A completed version of this notebook, the documented python code that you developed, and a report describing your research question, results and analysis. The report is expected in a short, concise format. It focusses on your specific research questions, results and discussion. The lecturers already know the background, the data and the general methodology. Your report therefore does not need to include an introduction on the clinical problem nor explanations of the background of image registration. You do have to include your design choices and motivation thereof.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aim to present your most important findings in the main body of the report and (if needed) any additional information in an appendix. The following report structure is suggested for the main body of the report:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Introduce research question and hypothesis with its motivation (0.5 page)\n",
    "2. Study design: which data did you use, what are the requirements of your method,\n",
    "why did you make certain choices. Be as complete as possible w.r.t. the components\n",
    "of a study design. (0.5 page)\n",
    "3. Method, experiments and results for each research question (2 pages)\n",
    "4. Discussion section with analysis of the results. (1 page)\n",
    "5. Contributions: a brief description by each group member of their activities in the project which can be used to to adjust individual grades to reflect a student’s (lack of) contribution to the group\n",
    "6. If you use large language models (such as ChatGPT) in your course work, you are required to declare how and for what they were used and to include a reflection on the use of such tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "The page lengths above are indications. You are free to adapt them, with the constraint of a maximum length of five pages for the first four items listed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The report must be submitted as a single PDF file. The documented code must be submitted as a single archive file (e.g. zip or 7z) that is self-contained and can be used to reproduce the results in the report. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there is no single correct solution for the project. You have to demonstrate to the reader that you understand the methods that you have studied and can critically analyze the results of applying the methods. Below, you can find a set of assignments (guided project work) that will help you get started with the project work and, when correctly completed, will present you with a **minimal solution**. Solutions which go beyond these assignments are of course encouraged. Additionally, include the solutions to the preliminary guided project work within this notebook in the archive file. \n",

    "The image dataset is located in the [image_data](https://github.com/tueimage/8BE030-MIA/tree/master/data/image_data) subfolder of the code for the registration exercises and project. The image filenames have the following format: `{Patient ID}_{Slice ID}_{Sequence}.tif`. For example, the filename `3_2_t1.tif` is the second slice from a T1-weighted scan of the third patient. Every T1 slice comes in two versions: original and transformed with some random transformation that can be identified with the `_d` suffix in the filename. This simulates a registration problem where you have to register two image acquisitions of the same patient (note however that some of the transformations that were used to simulate the second set of images are not realistic for brain imaging, e.g. brain scans typically do not encounter shearing between consecutive acquisitions).\n",
